## Description

**Block Bad Requests** helps you filter out specific URL strings from your WordPress site's output buffer. If you're dealing with unwanted or malicious scripts loading on your site, this plugin acts as a temporary fix. Note that it doesn't remove the underlying malicious code but prevents those HTTP calls from affecting your siteâ€™s output. For a more permanent solution, please consult a security professional.
